    "# Chinese Loans to Africa\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data:** `china-loans-to-africa.csv`\n",
    "* **Description:** A database of loans made between Chinese financiers and African recipients\n",
    "* **Source:** https://www.bu.edu/gdp/research/databases/global-china-databases/#Chinese-Loans\n",
    "* **Columns of interest:**\n",
    "    * `year` is the year of the loan\n",
    "    * `country` is the country of the loan recipient\n",
    "    * `region` is the region of Africa (CA = Central, EA = Eastern, etc). Note that `RG` is regional investment.\n",
    "    * `borrowerNotGouv` is the recipient of the loan\n",
    "    * `financier` is the (Chinese) source of the loan\n",
    "    * `cleanUSD` is the reported value converted to US dollars\n",
    "    * `purpose` is a description of what the loan is for\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that questions like \"What country has received the most loans from China?\" are an inaccurate way to portray the loans because the government of the country wasn't the loan recipient. Additionally, reports of these loans are collected by an organization, not released by an official source, so there are a thousand and one additional caveats about trusting the data. But I think generally you should be able to understand what I mean by my questions."
