# Python vs Command Line vs SQL

## Command Line (from Terminal)

"Command line commands"

* cd - changes directories/folders
* ls - lists files
* la -la - lists files in a better way!!!
* python filename.py
    * Means "Hey Python, run the Python code in this file"

## Python

Python code goes in a Python file, then you run it from Terminal

* print("Hello world")
* numbers = [4, 5, 6]
* len(numbers)

## SQL

Can only be run in a SQL prompt

Which you can get to from the command line!!!
