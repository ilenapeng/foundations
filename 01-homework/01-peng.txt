Homework 01, Part 2

-- are my own notes for future reference from our group work session!
-- Renamed file to remove spaces first & also deleted row 2 (which contained miscellaneous info that wasn't column names or an accident)
-[letter] -> is called a flag

cat OSHAfatalitiesFY2017.csv

1. How many accidents are in the file?
397 accidents
wc -l OSHAfatalitiesFY2017.csv

2. I want to know what companies were involved in explosions. 
grep explosion OSHAfatalitiesFY2017.csv | cut -d "," -f2
-- This looks at only the second column. Comma is because this is a CSV. Use the comma, go to the second line, cut the second one

Can you search the file to only show falls?
grep fall OSHAfatalitiesFY2017.csv
-- Note: this includes waterfalls and everything: Harsha's solution: "in falls|after falling"

3. I would like a file of only 2017 accidents. How many lines is in it?
158 lines
grep 17 OSHAfatalitiesFY2017.csv | wc -l

4. What command would I use to show me ONLY the first line of the file?
head -n 1 OSHAfatalitiesFY2017.csv
-- Can just do head -1 OSHAfatalitiesFY2017.csv

5. How many accidents involved forklifts? Also, save them to a file.
12 accidents
grep forklift OSHAfatalitiesFY2017.csv | wc -l
grep forklift OSHAfatalitiesFY2017.csv > OSHA_forklift.csv	

6. How many accidents were on Christmas Eve? Also, save them to a file.
2 accidents
grep 12/24 OSHAfatalitiesFY2017.csv | wc -l
grep 12/24 OSHAfatalitiesFY2017.csv > OSHA_xmaseve.csv	

7. I need a text file of accidents that involve trees!
grep -w tree OSHAfatalitiesFY2017.csv > OSHA_trees.txt
-- both -w and "" returns exact matches
